This is a project I am doing for my Bloc. graduation and the goal is to create the following:

<strong>Blocitoff</strong> will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.
